# Intro to Vidlium Software

‚ö°Ô∏è Let's explore **Vidlium in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is it?

Vidlium is a website that acts as software which facilitates sending video between a phone, tablet, or desktop to be recorded or send to a program like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). 

For users, it looks like a simple video chat, but directors have fine-grain control over their guest's experiences. Specifically, vidlium provides tools to control all settings avalable for a guest's camera, to move and manage guests around, and to personalize and *brand* their view of the software.

## What is the cost?

Vidlium software is free and is in fact open source with a [GPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license*. This means anyone can view and modify the code! What this means for cost though is that the code and software will always be free and open for people to use.

:::note

There are plans for paid features in the future which can enhance vidlium software. This might include image/branding storage in the cloud or cloud storage for stream configurations.

**Vidlium will aways be free due to it's license** so nothing out now can be put behind a pay wall effectively.

:::

**Vidlium software is comprised of many different parts of code, check each part as it might have a different license. But it is mostly GPL-3. :D*


## Features

Vidlium contains many stand-out features which users can take advantage of now, such as:

- ‚úÖ **A fully serverless structure.** Everything is peer-to-peer and so is fast and secure.
- ‚úÖ **Full controls over guest cameras.** Perfect for professional livestreams and recordings.
- ‚úÖ **Advanced guest management.** Control who they see and what scenes/room they are in.
- ‚úÖ **A shared stream configuation.** Any co-directors connected also store all stream data.
- ‚úÖ **Custom plugin support.** People can add any custom functionality they need, free!

As well as things coming soon to the software, such as:

- üìù **Branding and personalization.** Soon directors can style guest's views.
- üìù **Director specific jobs.** Soon directors could be set to only control part(s) of a production.
- üìù **Pop-out pages.** Soon things like chat or a specific room could be popped out into a new window. 
- üìù **Desktop and mobile apps.** Soon there will be native apps for Vidlium software.

## Composition of these docs

Vidlium docs are comprised of many different docs and guides for different parts of Vidlium or different libraries related too it. To explore all the different docs and guides, see the main page for these docs [docs.vidlium.com](https://docs.vidlium.com).

Notibly, these docs do include documention for things like VDOwrapper, which isn't specific to vidlium and is more of a usefull library for [VDO.ninja](https://vdo.ninja). However it was developed because of its need for Vidlium software and so has been included here out of ease of access. Docs like those should be upfront about their relation to Vidlium in their introduction.
