# Intro to Vidlium Software

‚ö°Ô∏è Let's explore **Vidlium in less than 5 minutes**.

## What is it?

Vidlium is a video-chat website which facilitates sending video between a phone, tablet, or desktop to a program like [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/).

For guests, it looks and functions like a classic video-chat app, but for directors it can be much more powerful and customizable. Directors have fine-grain control over their guest's experiences. Specifically, vidlium provides tools to control all settings avalable for a guest's camera, to move and manage guests around, and to personalize and *brand* their view of the software.

## What is the cost?

Vidlium software is free and open source. With a [GPL-3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) license\*, anyone can view and use the code! Therfore, even if vidlium were to become a *completely* paid service *(which I don't have any plans for... ever)*, another person could download the code and host it free themselves.

:::note

There are plans for some paid **features** in the future which can enhance vidlium software. This might include image/branding storage in the cloud or cloud storage for stream configurations.

**Vidlium will aways be free due to it's license** so nothing out now can effectively be put behind a pay wall.

:::

**Vidlium software is comprised of many different parts of code, check each part as it might have a different license. But it is mostly GPL-3. :D*


## Features

Vidlium contains many stand-out features which users can take advantage of now, such as:

- ‚úÖ **A fully serverless structure.** Everything is peer-to-peer and so is fast and secure.
- ‚úÖ **Full controls over guest cameras.** Perfect for professional livestreams and recordings.
- ‚úÖ **Advanced guest management.** Control who they see and what scenes/room they are in.
- ‚úÖ **A shared stream configuation.** Any co-directors connected also store all stream data.
- ‚úÖ **Custom plugin support.** People can add any custom functionality they need, free!

As well as things coming soon to the software, such as:

- üìù **Branding and personalization.** Soon directors can style guest's views.
- üìù **Director specific jobs.** Soon directors could be set to only control part(s) of a production.
- üìù **Pop-out pages.** Soon things like chat or a specific room could be popped out into a new window. 
- üìù **Desktop and mobile apps.** Soon there will be native apps for Vidlium software.

## Composition of these docs

Vidlium docs (docs.vidlium.com) are comprised of many different code bases, and guides for different parts of Vidlium and the libraries related too it. To explore all the different docs and guides, see the main page for these docs [docs.vidlium.com](https://docs.vidlium.com).

For example, these docs include documention for things like the VDOwrapper library, which isn't technically specific to Vidlium and is more of a usefull library for [VDO.ninja](https://vdo.ninja) as a whole. However, it was developed to be used in Vidlium software -- but just built in a way to be useful for other developers with other use cases -- so it has been included here out of ease of access.

Docs and guides like these which aren't technically specific to vidlium software, have that listed upfront in their introduction pages.
